# AlamazeTurnParser
Set of tools for parsing and displaying turn results from the Alamaze PBEM game.

This is a thinking man's strategy game and has no flashy graphics. 
In fact, the turn results are just a PDF file which is 98% flat text.
But they are chock-full of information and it is easy to miss something.

This toolset consists mainly of a Ruby script that can parse those PDF files,
extract useful information, and save it to a CSV file. The other main
script is a Ruby/Tk GUI which presents the map of the world. It can read
the CSV files generated by the parser, dispay the information on the map,
and generate other repors.
