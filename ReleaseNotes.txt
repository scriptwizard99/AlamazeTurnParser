Release Notes for the Alamaze Turn Parser

Version 2.2.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Found that some of the reports of the Choosing do not have version numbers in
  the html results. Updated code to notice "Alamaze The Choosing" in the results
  and decide that it is 3rd cycle.

Version 2.2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed bug processing group recon when nearly everything shows 'masked'
  Prior to fix, those groups would not show up in the results.
- Updated to handle the extra defense columns listed for population centers
  in the production section. Since I was rushing this fix out, I am recording
  the Adjusted Defense and throwing away the Base Defense. The reports have not
  changed. Know that the Defense listed is the Adjusted Defense.

Version 2.1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Region borders are GONE! (due to request by Rick)
- Each population center's right-click context menu now contains a Highlight Region option.
  Selecting this will cause all of the areas in that region to be highlighted with a red box.
  So, there are no more ugly white lines on the map, detracting from immersion, 
  but you can still easily identify the region borders for regions you are in.
- Minor fix to High Council report to handle a kingdom being denigrated in a region

Version 2.0.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added the Necromancer (Fix for issue #26)
  - Abbreviation is NE which used to be Neutral
  - Neutral changed to NU
- Changed colors of Necromancer and Tyrant (Fix for issue #27)
  - Tyrant was dark grey and looked too close to neutral
- Added Help menu which displays a text-only version of the instructions
- Agents now show up on the EmmyTool so you can make use of the range finder.
- For 3rd cycle, the Yes/No values of the InRange field have been replaced with 
  the actual range since the max range is not constant for all emissaries of all
  kingdoms

Version 2.0.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Lines for Group Movement Plotter do not disappear when changing groups
  - They are not saved, but they will stay there until file is closed.
  - Instead of black, they are now the kingdom's color.
- Parser now picks up 710, 720, and 976 orders and marks areas explored.
  - I was too lazy to handle 715 and 725
  - Everything is marked as 'no pc', even if there is a PC there.
  - The last area should be marked as 'all clear', but I didn't do that yet either.

Version 2.0.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Can now process results for Third Cycle games.
  Still alpha code (mostly untested)
  Artifact information not processed
  No special handling for new emissary times (is there anything to do?)
  Colors for new kingdoms might overlap existing kingdoms.
  Most other things *seem* to work OK, but I expect bugs.

Version 1.9.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Updated the grid boxes to be hidden when not highlighted.
  That makes the region borders easier to see, even on the small map.
- Added bindingd to the groups and pop centers so that the location text at
  the bottom of the window would update. That binding had been on the grid boxes,
  but with them gone, there was no location information to display.
- Parser now picks up when a battle occurs. All it grabs is the location,
  the attacker, and the defender.
- GUI now shows crossed swords on the map where a battle occurred (current turn only)
- Battle markers can be toggled with the 'b' key or by menu.
- Battle history is included when you click on a pop center 
- Can get a report of all battles that occurred
- Fixed Issue #23. Closing the output text window no longer keeps you from saving.
- Updated instructions document

Version 1.9.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Updated disclaimer at the bottom of the Emissary Tool to be more clear.
- Made Emissary Tool text window taller to make sure you can see disclaimer.

Version 1.9.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Correct calculations for the Emissary Tool. They are now closer to what is in
  the Frost Lord 320/330 tool. However, they always assume a worst case but 
  do not take into account any emissaries issing status quo orders. 
- Now parses out voting status from the High Council
- GUI has a report to show the data
- The dialog to parse turns remembers where you left it so that you do not
  need to keep navigating to the same directory over and over again. 
- The dialog to parse turns now allows you to select multiple turns at once.
- There are now three sizes of the map, accessable via the map menu.
  Zoom Out - takes you to the smallest map (the default map in previous versions)
  Zoom In Medium - takes you to an intermediat size map. This size includes making
                   the map window bigger too
  Zoom In Big - this map is the biggest; however, the map window does not get any bigger
                because it then would not fit on some people's screens. There are scrollbars.

Version 1.8.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Updated so GUI will still come up even if the PDF gem cannot be found.
- Executable built with a newer version of ocra (1.3.5)

Version 1.8.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Updated so it can understand more than one kingdom at a time. For example, 
  if you are playing a warlords format, you can parse the turns from all of 
  your kingdoms and then switch between the kingdoms to see regional reactions
  and other kingdom-centric reports. Also, the Emissary Tool now shows the 
  emissaries, influence, and reaction levels of the kingdom you selected.
- Changing the kingdom is accomplished via the Change Kingdom option on the Map menu.
- You can tell which kingdom you are by looking at the big green bar above the map.
- Note that region and influence information is based on the latest turn.
  What this means is that if you have parsed turn 4 for most of your kingdoms
  but not all of them, then the ones whose latest information is only for turn 3
  will appear to have no regional reactions and no emissaries. Just parse turn 4
  for that kingdom and they will all magically come back.
- The map menu also has Zoom In and Zoom Out items which let you switch between
  the big map and the small map. The functionality has always been there, but now
  you do not have to remember Control+UpArrow and Control+DownArrow. 
- Removed the report buttons on the far right of the GUI. Those reports can
  now be accessed via the Reports menu.
- You should never need to run the fixRegion option off of the map menu. 
  I'm happy with that logic so now it runs whenever you load/parse results.

Version 1.7.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed bug where parsing the turn of another (presumablly allied) kingdom will 
  mark all of yours as lost

Version 1.7.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added dialog allowing users to enter population centers, emissaries, and 
  groups manually.
- Is now much better at detecting lost population centers.

Version 1.6.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Now properly parses html turn results version 1.0b
- Fixed issue #19. Now the tool will warn you that you have done nothing.
- When parsing/loading a turn from some other kingdom, the info and regional 
  reaction records will be ignored. 
- When pasting the movement orders from your turn into the Exploration dialog,
  the blank spaces are ignored. Previously, they were generating dozens of null 
  entries. You did not notice, though, unless you looked in the data file.

Version 1.5.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added item to the Map menu allowing you to toggle the exploration markers on and off
- Added item to the Map menu allowing you to toggle showing groups on and off
- Added the Group Movement Plotter (720) tool.

- Can also add a 'temp' marker that will NOT be saved.
- Now parses out the PC owner from the 'passed a PC' lines.
- Moved most of the *.rb files to a lib dir.
- Updated dist scripts to handle that

Version 1.2.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Detects ESO section in results instead of trying to parse them as artifact recon
- Fix for bug #11 for passed PCs

- Includes a windows executable for the command line parser to be used with 
  Thudargh's Excel map.

Version 1.1.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Adds an option to the right click context menu of a population center called 'Destroy PC'. 
  Choosing this option does exactly that. It updates the owner to XX and the region to X. 
  The icon will change to a white X on a black background. You cannot un-destroy a PC

Version 1.1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Adds the 'Fix Regions' menu option which will check the region number in all 
  known population centers and fix any that are incorrect.

Version 1.0.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed a bug in 1.0.0 where it really didn't work for other users.

Version 1.0.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
