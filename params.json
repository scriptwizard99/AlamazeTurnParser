The other main\r\nscript is a Ruby/Tk GUI which presents the map of the world. It can read\r\nthe CSV files generated by the parser, dispay the information on the map,\r\nand generate other reports.\r\n\r\nWebsite for Alamaze: http://www.alamaze.co/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
