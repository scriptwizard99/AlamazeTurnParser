<pre>        shows which kingdoms have entered into marriages of state, a binding form of non-aggression</pre>
<pre>        which prevents hostile military and political actions toward the wedded kingdom. The chart</pre>

<pre>        always remain enemies throughout the camppaign. A kingdom's influence will rise and fall</pre>
<pre>        proportionally to the failures and successes of its natural enemy. To see the declarations a</pre>

<pre><i>     Reports of our Military engagements:</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>     Reconnaisance of unusual sighting in area BQ by a patrol of the 1st Dwarven: </pre>
<pre>      A patrol consisting of General II Willow, Captain I Kelzekar, Captain Pierznok and a</pre>
<pre>     dozen hand-picked troops rode ahead to investigate the sighting. It had been decided that</pre>
<pre>     the patrol will only scout the area and will retreat if danger presents itself. Without a</pre>
<pre>     wizard present, the force was at a disadvantage. It is now the 10th day of their quest. An</pre>
<pre>     abundance of mud and gunk covers their skin and armor and is baked firmly in place, making</pre>
<pre>     every movement and even speech painful and slow. The water they carry is precious and for</pre>
<pre>     drinking only. Climbing the crumbling steps to the top, the group finds a solitary alcove</pre>
<pre>     with many slits in the stone circling the chamber that provides a 360 degree view of the</pre>
<pre>     area beyond the tower for some distance and alternately provides some light in this</pre>
<pre>     otherwise unilluminated room. Suddenly out of the shadows ahead appears 12 skeletal</pre>
<pre>     fighters, and a single fell warrior, standing 7' tall and clad in shadowy plate mail and</pre>
<pre>     wielding a flaming sword! They launch into attack! In the first moments of battle 6</pre>
<pre>     warriors were slain by this fiendish enemy. The conflict was furious. The the black</pre>
<pre>     phantom warrior proved to be a very formidable opponent. The battle raged on, furiously</pre>
<pre>     contested for what seemed hours. Flaming sword screaming angrily through the air as more</pre>
<pre>     blood was let from the side of the patrol. The next few minutes saw 3 soldiers lose their</pre>
<pre>     lives, but the enemy had been weakened.  Dwarven leader Captain I Kelzekar was slain in</pre>
<pre>     battle. The battle raged on, furiously contested for what seemed like hours. The next few</pre>
<pre>     minutes saw 2 soldiers lose their lives, but the enemy had been weakened. General Willow</pre>
<pre>     demonstrated uncommon valor through out the fray. Fighting bravely in the battle was</pre>
<pre>     Captain Pierznok. Despite the valiant effort, the dark warrior proved too much to overcome</pre>
<pre>     and a retreat was ordered. The patrol made a hasty withdrawal with it's surviving members,</pre>
<pre>     reporting heavy-hearted back to the group. </pre>

<pre>     disadvantage. It is now the 10th day of their quest. An abundance of mud and gunk covers</pre>
<pre>     their skin and armor and is baked firmly in place, making every movement and even speech</pre>
<pre>     painful and slow. The water they carry is precious and for drinking only. Climbing the</pre>
<pre>     crumbling steps to the top, the group finds a solitary alcove with many slits in the stone</pre>
<pre>     circling the chamber that provides a 360 degree view of the area beyond the tower for some</pre>
<pre>     distance and alternately provides some light in this otherwise unilluminated room.</pre>
<pre>     Suddenly out of the shadows ahead appears 12 skeletal fighters, and a single fell warrior,</pre>
<pre>     standing 7' tall and clad in shadowy plate mail and wielding a flaming sword! They launch</pre>
<pre>     into attack! In the first moments of battle 6 warriors were slain by this fiendish enemy.</pre>
<pre>     The conflict was furious. The the black phantom warrior proved to be a very formidable</pre>
<pre>     opponent. The battle raged on, furiously contested for what seemed hours. Flaming sword</pre>
<pre>     screaming angrily through the air as more blood was let from the side of the patrol. The</pre>
<pre>     next few minutes saw 3 soldiers lose their lives, but the enemy had been weakened.  Blows</pre>
<pre>     striking with great force, more blood was let from the side of the patrol. The next few</pre>
<pre>     minutes saw 5 warriors perish. Hope ran high, though, as the foe was weakened. Bravely</pre>
<pre>     aiding the patrol was Captain Lerix. Despite the valiant effort, the dark warrior proved</pre>
<pre>     too much to overcome and a retreat was ordered. The patrol made a hasty withdrawal with</pre>
<pre>     it's surviving members, reporting heavy-hearted back to the group. </pre>

<pre>     Each spellcaster may cast one spell per turn. Spells cast count as orders used against the</pre>
<pre>     king's influence order limitation. Each spell requires the spell # to be placed in the</pre>
<pre>     Order # column of the turn input sheet, the group ID of the wizard's group to be placed in</pre>
<pre>     Column 'A', and the wizard's power-level (eg:'2') or the specific casting wizard's</pre>
<pre>     initials to be placed in Column 'B'. Other columns may need to be completed as dictated by</pre>
<pre>     the specific spell description. Spells not properly completed are miscast and have no</pre>
<pre>     effect. We suggest that you use either power levels, or the first two letters of the</pre>
<pre>     wizard’s name, but not both in any given turn in order to avoid any confusion around which</pre>
<pre>     wizard may or may not be used.</pre>

<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Protect Heroes and Wizards               Spell #:   94</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By casting this spell, the wizard seeks to protect all heroes and wizards of his</pre>
<pre>      group from the black magics of a particular opposing group's spellcasters. This spell</pre>
<pre>      is always successful, but is only effective against one group and may only be cast</pre>
<pre>      upon the group in which the wizard is located. It protects all the group's leaders</pre>
<pre>      and wizards, even against multiple attacks unless dispelled. Put group ID of target</pre>
<pre>      group in Column "C".</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Stun Leader                              Spell #:   95</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      The wizard casting this spell seeks to render the opposing commander ineffective for</pre>
<pre>      the duration of a battle. Your group must engage the target group in combat for this</pre>
<pre>      spell to be effective. Base chance of success is 100% * difference in level of</pre>
<pre>      ability (general considered equal to power-2 wizard for this purpose). eg: A power-1</pre>
<pre>      wizard has a 33% {100%*(1/3)} of stunning a marshal. Put group ID of target group in</pre>
<pre>      Column "C".</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Create Food                              Spell #:  208</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      Wizards in Alamaze can create bountiful quantities of food out of almost any organic</pre>
<pre>      substance. In game terms, a wizard can create food equal to 2000 units * his power</pre>
<pre>      level (eg: a power-3  wizard creates 6000 food) by casting this spell. Food created</pre>
<pre>      is added to available quantities on hand. No Columns beyond Column "B" need be</pre>
<pre>      completed.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Learn Artifact Power                     Spell #:  796</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By using this spell, a wizard can learn what powers are stored within an artifact in</pre>
<pre>      his kingdom's possession. Information learned may be of a general nature, but it will</pre>
<pre>      be sufficient to enable the king to know best how to utilize the artifact. Artifact</pre>
<pre>      must be in the same area as the wizard. Put the short name of the artifact in Column</pre>
<pre>      "C". Only very basic information will be learned.</pre>

<br>
<pre>      This is the means by which a spellcaster advances his power. The wizard must be</pre>
<pre>      located in a kingdom controlled population center in order to perform his research.</pre>
<pre>      The cost to the controlling king is shown on the setup sheet data (eg: if cost shown</pre>
<pre>      is 10,000 gold per level, it would cost 20,000 gold to advance from power-1 to</pre>
<pre>      power-2). No Columns beyond Column "B" need be completed.</pre>

<br>
<pre>      By using this spell a wizard may order his raven familiar to perform a reconnaisance</pre>
<pre>      of an area exactly as a first level agent would. The target area must be within a ten</pre>

<pre>     Each spellcaster may cast one spell per turn. Spells cast count as orders used against the</pre>

<pre>     Order # column of the turn input sheet, the group ID of the wizard's group to be placed in</pre>
<pre>     Column 'A', and the wizard's power-level (eg:'2') or the specific casting wizard's</pre>

<pre>     the specific spell description. Spells not properly completed are miscast and have no</pre>
<pre>     effect. We suggest that you use either power levels, or the first two letters of the</pre>

<pre><i>     Name:    Kill Leader/Wizard                       Spell #:   96</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      The wizard casting this spell seeks to slay a particular opposing hero or</pre>
<pre>      spellcaster. The base chance of success is 50% * difference in level of ability</pre>
<pre>      (general considered equal to a power-2 wizard for this purpose). eg: A power-1 wizard</pre>
<pre>      has a 16.3% {50%*(1/3)} of slaying a marshal and a power-6 has a 75% chance of</pre>
<pre>      killing a power-4, and a power-3 has a 30% chance of killing a power-5. Put the group</pre>
<pre>      ID of the target group in Column "C", place "W" or "L" (for wizard or leader) in</pre>
<pre>      Column "D", place "H" or "L" (high or low) in Column "E". Your group need not have</pre>
<pre>      combat for this spell; but must be in the same location as the group containing the</pre>
<pre>      figure you desire to slay.</pre>

<pre><i>     Name:    Shield                                   Spell #:  100</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This spell causes a glimmering shield of magic to protect the force, and increases</pre>
<pre>      the defensive values of the wizard's group, effectively reducing the casualties it</pre>
<pre>      will suffer from battle with a specific opposing group or a population center. The</pre>
<pre>      amount of benefit received increases with the power level of the spellcaster. Put the</pre>
<pre>      group ID of the opposing target group in Column "C", or if cast against a population</pre>
<pre>      center, leave Column "C" blank.</pre>

<br>
<pre>      The lightning attack is the most commonly known offensive battle spell. The spell</pre>
<pre>      sends dozens of lightning bolts screaming through enemy formations. The power of the</pre>
<pre>      attack is dependent upon spellcaster power: 500 points per level. Your group must</pre>
<pre>      battle the target group for the spell to be effective. Put group ID of target group</pre>
<pre>      in Column "C", or if cast against a population center, leave Column "C" blank.</pre>

<br>
<pre>      By casting this spell the wizard creates illusionary sights, sounds and smells</pre>
<pre>      intended to terrify enemy soldiers. The effect is a drop of 10% in the morale, and so</pre>
<pre>      fighting ability, of the enemy troops for the duration of the battle (not a permanent</pre>
<pre>      effect). Your group must battle the target group for the spell to be effective. Put</pre>
<pre>      group ID of target group in Column "C". Not effective against population centers.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Valor                                    Spell #:  108</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      The wizard casts this spell as battle is about to begin. Invigorating aromas spread</pre>
<pre>      through the ranks, filling the minds of the troops with thoughts of heroism, courage</pre>
<pre>      and determination. Morale is increased by 10% for the  duration of the combat. Your</pre>
<pre>      group must battle the target group for the spell to be effective. Put group ID of</pre>
<pre>      target group in Column "C", or if cast against a population center, leave Column "C"</pre>

<br>
<pre>      A wizard may cast this spell when his group intends to parley with a population</pre>
<pre>      center. The group's effectiveness will be increased in proportion to his power level.</pre>
<pre>      Use this spell instead of order #170 (not in addition to it). By using this spell the</pre>
<pre>      groups leaders appear more charismatic to the center's leaders than they otherwise</pre>
<pre>      would. No Columns beyond Column "B" need be completed. This spell has no effect if</pre>
<pre>      the population center is a capital. Regional reaction, enemy status, previous month's</pre>
<pre>      status quo, and the population center's defenses impact upon the chance of success.</pre>
<pre>      In Second Cycle, this spell, when used in an effort to gain a city must overcome the</pre>
<pre>      same percentage negitive modifier as political actions.</pre>

<br>
<pre>      Wizards can create gold from lesser metals in sizeable quantities, although the</pre>
<pre>      procedure can take several weeks. In game terms, a wizard can create gold equal to</pre>
<pre>      2000 units * his power level (eg: a power-3  wizard creates 6000 gold) by casting</pre>
<pre>      this spell. Gold created is added to available quantities on hand. No Columns beyond</pre>

<br>
<pre>      This spell protects a specific emissary of any kingdom from the black magic of an</pre>
<pre>      opposing spellcaster, and helps guard against foul play of the more earthly variety.</pre>
<pre>      Spells directed against the warded emissary will be ineffective, and other attacks</pre>
<pre>      against him will have a 20% diminished chance of working. A ward spell effectively</pre>
<pre>      hids an emissary from a locate spell. Place the kingdom abbreviation to which the</pre>
<pre>      emissary belongs in Column "C", and the emissary abbreviation in Column "D".</pre>

<pre>      This incantation allows a mage to increase the existing defenses of the population</pre>
<pre>      center in the same area as his group by 2,000, permanently. The population center</pre>
<pre>      need not be controlled by the spellcaster's kingdom. No Columns beyond Column "B"</pre>

<br>
<pre>      By casting this spell, the wizard creates a fleet of mist-made ships, enough to</pre>
<pre>      transport one brigade per power-level magically over any sea. movement is at the</pre>
<pre>      normal rate for the kingdom. In addition, the group is not subject to interdiction by</pre>

<br>
<pre>      The wizard creates an invigorating aroma which greatly aids the groups movement</pre>
<pre>      capabilities. Movement allowance is increased 2.5 pts. per level of the spellcaster.</pre>
<pre>      (power-2 caster's group could move 25 points.) Use in place of normal movement order.</pre>
<pre>      Limit of 8 areas maximum movement. This spell will not increase sea movement and can</pre>

<pre>      and above, significantly increasing their combat abilities. This bonus increases in</pre>

<pre><i>     Name:    Dispel Magic                             Spell #:   92</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This spell is directed against a group containing spellcasters in the same area as</pre>
<pre>      the casting wizard's group. This spell has a 100% chance of dispelling a battle spell</pre>
<pre>      of an equal or lessor level wizard, less 25% per level disparity when attempting to</pre>
<pre>      dispel incantations of a higher level spellcaster. You may optionally list in Column</pre>
<pre>      D the lowest spell # you wish to dispel (eg- "98"). Your group need not engage in</pre>
<pre>      combat to use this spell. Put group ID of target group in Column "C".</pre>

<pre><i>     Name:    Guarded Attack                           Spell #:  101</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This is a sophisticated spell in which the spellcaster becomes invisible, thereby</pre>
<pre>      protecting himself from the hazards of battle, and sends forth powerful sonic blasts</pre>
<pre>      into the enemy lines, inflicting casualties in proportion to the spellcasters power:</pre>
<pre>      300 points per level. Your group must battle the target group for the spell to be</pre>
<pre>      effective. Put group ID of target group in Column "C", or if cast against a</pre>
<pre>      population center or in an unusual sighting, leave Column "C" blank. When used in an</pre>
<pre>      unusual sighting it reduces the wizard's effectiveness by 50%.</pre>

<br>
<pre>      The firestrike is a powerful offensive battle spell. The spell sends rolling waves of</pre>
<pre>      magically hot flames sizzling into enemy lines. The power of the attack is dependent</pre>
<pre>      upon spellcaster power: 700 points per level. Your group must battle the target group</pre>

<br>
<pre>      This spell places the target emissary in a magically deep sleep, similar to a coma.</pre>
<pre>      The emissary remains in such a state for one month (the game turn) during which time</pre>
<pre>      he obviously can perform no activity. A slept emissary is more susceptible to</pre>
<pre>      kidnapping and assassination attempts. There are various types of magic that can</pre>
<pre>      effect the success of this spell. This spell requires  the caster to know the</pre>
<pre>      target's name (and so emissary abb.), his kingdom, and his location. Place the</pre>
<pre>      kingdom abbreviation to which the emissary belongs in "C", the emissary abbreviation</pre>
<pre>      in "D", and the location in "E".</pre>

<br>
<pre>      By casting this spell a mage increases the food production of the population center</pre>
<pre>      his group is in by 2,500, permanently. The population center need not be controlled</pre>
<pre>      by the spellcaster's kingdom. No Columns beyond Column "B" need be completed. Note:</pre>
<pre>      As this spell is after production the increase will be reflected on the next result.</pre>

<br>
<pre>      When located in the same area as a population center, by casting this spell a mage</pre>
<pre>      can uncover hidden ore reserves in that area. Gold production of the population</pre>
<pre>      center will increase by 2500 gold permanently. No Columns beyond Column "B" need be</pre>
<pre>      completed. Note: As this spell is after production, the increase will be reflected on</pre>

<br>
<pre>      This spell is very similar to the dispel magic spell, however instead of dispelling</pre>
<pre>      battle spells, it works against the Storm at Sea spell. The same chance of success as</pre>
<pre>      exists in Dispel Magic apply here (100% chance of dispelling versus equal or lesser</pre>
<pre>      level wizard, less 25% per level disparity when attempting to dispel incantation of a</pre>
<pre>      higher level spellcaster). The spellcaster must be within 3 areas of any area</pre>
<pre>      comprising that sea.  Specify the first letter of the sea to be effected in Column</pre>
<pre>      "C", and an area of the sea within 3 areas of the wizard in Column "D".</pre>

<pre>      This spell offers the group containing the spellcaster the means to be protected from</pre>
<pre>      the effects of a non-allied wizard's regional effect spell. This peculiar spell will</pre>
<pre>      protect the group from a single regional effect spell only; there is no way to</pre>

<pre>      This spell is very similar to the dispel magic spell, however instead of dispelling</pre>
<pre>      battle spells, it works against regional effect spells (#781-788). This spell has a</pre>
<pre>      100% chance of dispelling a regional spell of an equal or lessor level wizard, less</pre>

<pre><i>     Name:    Heal                                     Spell #:  815</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      The wizard dedicates his time and magical energy to imbue additional food rations for</pre>
<pre>      his group with restorative powers. By consuming this magical food, the group's</pre>
<pre>      wounded memebers are restored to fighting capability and attrition reduced according</pre>
<pre>      to the following schedule: Brigade sized groups require an additional 4000 food and</pre>
<pre>      have their attrition reduced by 5 points. Division sized groups require an additional</pre>
<pre>      8000 food and have their attrition reduced by 4 points. Army sized groups require and</pre>
<pre>      additional 16000 food and have their attrition reduced by 3 points. This spell will</pre>
<pre>      have reduced effectiveness if a previous healing has been performed on the group,</pre>
<pre>      either by a high priestess order or a previous casting of this spell. If the group</pre>
<pre>      has been healed once before, attrition will be reduced by 2 fewer points than listed</pre>
<pre>      above (eg. brigade sized groups will reduce attrition by 3, division by 2, army by</pre>
<pre>      only 1). The spell will have no effect, other than food consumption, if the group has</pre>
<pre>      already received two prior healings through any combination of high priestess orders</pre>
<pre>      or spells. No Columns beyond "B" are required.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Lesser Masking                           Spell #:  821</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By using this spell the wizard through use of mist, smoke, and illusion obscures the</pre>
<pre>      size of his smaller sized (up to 5 brigades) group. Foreign groups (and possibly</pre>
<pre>      agents) will be unable to determine the group size or strength. If used in a group</pre>
<pre>      larger than division sized there will be no effect. A successful casting will result</pre>
<pre>      in the group size will be reported as "masked". No Columns beyond Column "B" need be</pre>
<pre>      completed.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Teleport Self                            Spell #:  830</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By using this spell the wizard can teleport himself in to another group of his</pre>
<pre>      kingdom, regardless of distance from  his present location. The receiving group must</pre>
<pre>      be of his own kingdom, and cannot already contain three wizards. Place the receiving</pre>
<pre>      group's ID in Column "C". There are no distance or area restrictions with this spell.</pre>

<pre><i>     Name:    Locate Character or Group                Spell #:  855</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This spell allows the spellcaster to learn, through deep trance-induced meditations,</pre>
<pre>      the location of a specific group or emissary of any kingdom. certain magic may</pre>
<pre>      interfere with this process (such as a Ward spell) but normally it is quite</pre>
<pre>      effective. Place "G" or"E" (group or emissary) in Column "C", the group ID or</pre>
<pre>      emissary abb. in Column "D", and the kingdom abb.of the group or emissary in Column</pre>
