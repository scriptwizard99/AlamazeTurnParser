<pre>     Each spellcaster may cast one spell per turn. Spells cast count as orders used against the</pre>

<pre>     Order # column of the turn input sheet, the group ID of the wizard's group to be placed in</pre>
<pre>     Column 'A', and the wizard's power-level (eg:'2') or the specific casting wizard's</pre>
<pre>     initials to be placed in Column 'B'. Other columns may need to be completed as dictated by</pre>
<pre>     the specific spell description. Spells not properly completed are miscast and have no</pre>
<pre>     effect. We suggest that you use either power levels, or the first two letters of the</pre>
<pre>     wizard’s name, but not both in any given turn in order to avoid any confusion around which</pre>
<pre>     wizard may or may not be used.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Protect Heroes and Wizards               Spell #:   94</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By casting this spell, the wizard seeks to protect all heroes and wizards of his</pre>
<pre>      group from the black magics of a particular opposing group's spellcasters. This spell</pre>
<pre>      is always successful, but is only effective against one group and may only be cast</pre>
<pre>      upon the group in which the wizard is located. It protects all the group's leaders</pre>
<pre>      and wizards, even against multiple attacks unless dispelled. Put group ID of target</pre>
<pre>      group in Column "C".</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Stun Leader                              Spell #:   95</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      The wizard casting this spell seeks to render the opposing commander ineffective for</pre>
<pre>      the duration of a battle. Your group must engage the target group in combat for this</pre>
<pre>      spell to be effective. Base chance of success is 100% * difference in level of</pre>
<pre>      ability (general considered equal to power-2 wizard for this purpose). eg: A power-1</pre>
<pre>      wizard has a 33% {100%*(1/3)} of stunning a marshal. Put group ID of target group in</pre>
<pre>      Column "C".</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Lightning Attack                         Spell #:  102</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      The lightning attack is the most commonly known offensive battle spell. The spell</pre>
<pre>      sends dozens of lightning bolts screaming through enemy formations. The power of the</pre>
<pre>      attack is dependent upon spellcaster power: 500 points per level. Your group must</pre>
<pre>      battle the target group for the spell to be effective. Put group ID of target group</pre>
<pre>      in Column "C", or if cast against a population center, leave Column "C" blank.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Valor                                    Spell #:  108</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      The wizard casts this spell as battle is about to begin. Invigorating aromas spread</pre>
<pre>      through the ranks, filling the minds of the troops with thoughts of heroism, courage</pre>
<pre>      and determination. Morale is increased by 10% for the  duration of the combat. Your</pre>
<pre>      group must battle the target group for the spell to be effective. Put group ID of</pre>
<pre>      target group in Column "C", or if cast against a population center, leave Column "C"</pre>
<pre>      blank.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Diplomacy                                Spell #:  171</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      A wizard may cast this spell when his group intends to parley with a population</pre>
<pre>      center. The group's effectiveness will be increased in proportion to his power level.</pre>
<pre>      Use this spell instead of order #170 (not in addition to it). By using this spell the</pre>
<pre>      groups leaders appear more charismatic to the center's leaders than they otherwise</pre>
<pre>      would. No Columns beyond Column "B" need be completed. This spell has no effect if</pre>
<pre>      the population center is a capital. Regional reaction, enemy status, previous month's</pre>
<pre>      status quo, and the population center's defenses impact upon the chance of success.</pre>
<pre>      In Second Cycle, this spell, when used in an effort to gain a city must overcome the</pre>
<pre>      same percentage negitive modifier as political actions.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Create Food                              Spell #:  208</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      Wizards in Alamaze can create bountiful quantities of food out of almost any organic</pre>
<pre>      substance. In game terms, a wizard can create food equal to 2000 units * his power</pre>
<pre>      level (eg: a power-3  wizard creates 6000 food) by casting this spell. Food created</pre>
<pre>      is added to available quantities on hand. No Columns beyond Column "B" need be</pre>
<pre>      completed.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Ward                                     Spell #:  301</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This spell protects a specific emissary of any kingdom from the black magic of an</pre>
<pre>      opposing spellcaster, and helps guard against foul play of the more earthly variety.</pre>
<pre>      Spells directed against the warded emissary will be ineffective, and other attacks</pre>
<pre>      against him will have a 20% diminished chance of working. A ward spell effectively</pre>
<pre>      hids an emissary from a locate spell. Place the kingdom abbreviation to which the</pre>
<pre>      emissary belongs in Column "C", and the emissary abbreviation in Column "D".</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Learn Artifact Power                     Spell #:  796</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By using this spell, a wizard can learn what powers are stored within an artifact in</pre>
<pre>      his kingdom's possession. Information learned may be of a general nature, but it will</pre>
<pre>      be sufficient to enable the king to know best how to utilize the artifact. Artifact</pre>
<pre>      must be in the same area as the wizard. Put the short name of the artifact in Column</pre>
<pre>      "C". Only very basic information will be learned.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Magic Research                           Spell #:  799</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This is the means by which a spellcaster advances his power. The wizard must be</pre>
<pre>      located in a kingdom controlled population center in order to perform his research.</pre>
<pre>      The cost to the controlling king is shown on the setup sheet data (eg: if cost shown</pre>
<pre>      is 10,000 gold per level, it would cost 20,000 gold to advance from power-1 to</pre>
<pre>      power-2). No Columns beyond Column "B" need be completed.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Raven Familiar                           Spell #:  888</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By using this spell a wizard may order his raven familiar to perform a reconnaisance</pre>
<pre>      of an area exactly as a first level agent would. The target area must be within a ten</pre>
<pre>      area range of the spellcaster's group. The results will be reported in the "agents on</pre>
<pre>      reconnaisance" section of the status update. Put target area in Column "C".</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><p class="hdr1red">     Power-2 Spells for the Giant</p></pre>
<pre>     Each spellcaster may cast one spell per turn. Spells cast count as orders used against the</pre>
<pre>     king's influence order limitation. Each spell requires the spell # to be placed in the</pre>
<pre>     Order # column of the turn input sheet, the group ID of the wizard's group to be placed in</pre>
<pre>     Column 'A', and the wizard's power-level (eg:'2') or the specific casting wizard's</pre>
<pre>     initials to be placed in Column 'B'. Other columns may need to be completed as dictated by</pre>
<pre>     the specific spell description. Spells not properly completed are miscast and have no</pre>
<pre>     effect. We suggest that you use either power levels, or the first two letters of the</pre>
<pre>     wizard’s name, but not both in any given turn in order to avoid any confusion around which</pre>
<pre>     wizard may or may not be used.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Kill Leader/Wizard                       Spell #:   96</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      The wizard casting this spell seeks to slay a particular opposing hero or</pre>
<pre>      spellcaster. The base chance of success is 50% * difference in level of ability</pre>
<pre>      (general considered equal to a power-2 wizard for this purpose). eg: A power-1 wizard</pre>
<pre>      has a 16.3% {50%*(1/3)} of slaying a marshal and a power-6 has a 75% chance of</pre>
<pre>      killing a power-4, and a power-3 has a 30% chance of killing a power-5. Put the group</pre>
<pre>      ID of the target group in Column "C", place "W" or "L" (for wizard or leader) in</pre>
<pre>      Column "D", place "H" or "L" (high or low) in Column "E". Your group need not have</pre>
<pre>      combat for this spell; but must be in the same location as the group containing the</pre>
<pre>      figure you desire to slay.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Shield                                   Spell #:  100</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This spell causes a glimmering shield of magic to protect the force, and increases</pre>
<pre>      the defensive values of the wizard's group, effectively reducing the casualties it</pre>
<pre>      will suffer from battle with a specific opposing group or a population center. The</pre>
<pre>      amount of benefit received increases with the power level of the spellcaster. Put the</pre>
<pre>      group ID of the opposing target group in Column "C", or if cast against a population</pre>
<pre>      center, leave Column "C" blank.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Firestrike                               Spell #:  103</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      The firestrike is a powerful offensive battle spell. The spell sends rolling waves of</pre>
<pre>      magically hot flames sizzling into enemy lines. The power of the attack is dependent</pre>
<pre>      upon spellcaster power: 700 points per level. Your group must battle the target group</pre>
<pre>      for the spell to be effective. Put group ID of target group in Column "C", or if cast</pre>
<pre>      against a population center, leave Column "C" blank.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Fear                                     Spell #:  107</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By casting this spell the wizard creates illusionary sights, sounds and smells</pre>
<pre>      intended to terrify enemy soldiers. The effect is a drop of 10% in the morale, and so</pre>
<pre>      fighting ability, of the enemy troops for the duration of the battle (not a permanent</pre>
<pre>      effect). Your group must battle the target group for the spell to be effective. Put</pre>
<pre>      group ID of target group in Column "C". Not effective against population centers.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Create Gold                              Spell #:  209</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      Wizards can create gold from lesser metals in sizeable quantities, although the</pre>
<pre>      procedure can take several weeks. In game terms, a wizard can create gold equal to</pre>
<pre>      2000 units * his power level (eg: a power-3  wizard creates 6000 gold) by casting</pre>
<pre>      this spell. Gold created is added to available quantities on hand. No Columns beyond</pre>
<pre>      Column "B" need be completed.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Fertile Fields                           Spell #:  602</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By casting this spell a mage increases the food production of the population center</pre>
<pre>      his group is in by 2,500, permanently. The population center need not be controlled</pre>
<pre>      by the spellcaster's kingdom. No Columns beyond Column "B" need be completed. Note:</pre>
<pre>      As this spell is after production the increase will be reflected on the next result.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Ship of Mist                             Spell #:  708</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By casting this spell, the wizard creates a fleet of mist-made ships, enough to</pre>
<pre>      transport one brigade per power-level magically over any sea. movement is at the</pre>
<pre>      normal rate for the kingdom. In addition, the group is not subject to interdiction by</pre>
<pre>      sea patrol or the spell Storm at Sea. However, the group may not end its movement in</pre>
<pre>      a sea area. Movement can not be increased by any method. Use in place of a normal</pre>
<pre>      movement order, not in addition to. Complete Columns "C" on to indicate intended</pre>
<pre>      movement area by area.</pre>
