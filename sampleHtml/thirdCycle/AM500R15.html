<pre><p class="hdr1red">     Military Encounters and Group Readiness:</p></pre>
<pre><i>     Reports of our Military engagements:</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>     Reconnaisance of unusual sighting in area UR by a patrol of the 2nd Amazons: </pre>
<pre>      Wizard Dragonpass (Power-4) offered only a portion of his magic to the patrol's efforts</pre>
<pre>     as he decided to cast a guarded attack spell and protect himself from the unknown. Wizard</pre>
<pre>     Freehaven (Power-4) decided to stay behind in camp and will not be a factor in assisting</pre>
<pre>     the patrol. Wizard Cunnafor (Power-1) decided to stay behind in camp and will not be a</pre>
<pre>     factor in assisting the patrol. A patrol consisting of Commander Chaos, Major General</pre>
<pre>     Turingoth, Centurion Tanabor, Power-4 Wizard Dragonpass and a dozen hand-picked troops</pre>
<pre>     rode ahead to investigate the sighting. It had been decided that there would be no plan to</pre>
<pre>     retreat. The patrol was willing to take great risks to uncover what might be secreted</pre>
<pre>     ahead. Appearing strangely out of place is a black monolithic structure of 40' per side</pre>
<pre>     and 40' height built from materials not found in this area. runes on one side read</pre>
<pre>     "unending pain and inexplicable horror await any heretic who dares to enter". Undaunted,</pre>
<pre>     the patrol go in. As each member of the group pass the threshold, images of various</pre>
<pre>     terrors form in their minds and a cold sweat appears on their brow. Somehow the monolith</pre>
<pre>     warps space, as the interior appears many times larger than the 40' exterior. The interior</pre>
<pre>     has its own dim light, from an unknown source. The patrol continues ahead. materializing</pre>
<pre>     directly in front of the group is the obscure image of a ghost. moving mist-like toward</pre>
<pre>     the startled patrol this evil aberration seeks to embrace each living being. The</pre>
<pre>     horrifying experience of seeing fellow members age dramatically, and even die through that</pre>
<pre>     process, will forever linger in the minds and dreams of the patrol. By raising the Great</pre>
<pre>     Axe of Hurblind Commander Chaos infused his patrol with boldness and propelled them</pre>
<pre>     forward.  In a setback, the Amazons Commander Chaos perished. Turingoth impressed and has</pre>
<pre>     been recognized as a Commander. Surpassing expectations was Tanabor, who again has won</pre>
<pre>     further glory. He is now a Captain. In the heroic tradition of the Amazons kingdom, a</pre>
<pre>     glorius leader has distinguished himself in this engagement. He is Centurion Xhose. The</pre>
<pre>     battle raged on, furiously contested for what seemed like hours. The next few minutes saw</pre>
<pre>     2 soldiers lose their lives, but the enemy had been weakened. Fighting bravely in the</pre>
<pre>     battle was Captain Tanabor. Never the less, the remaining members of the stalwart compose</pre>
<pre>     themselves and move tediously to unearth the costly rarity the ghost was guarding. With</pre>
<pre>     the battle over, the group finds an interesting object nearby. The Palantir Crisnia allows</pre>
<pre>     a king to view an area as if an agent were located there: use Order #972, put the short</pre>
<pre>     name in Column "A", area to be viewed in Column "B". The impressive foe subdued, the</pre>

<pre>     Assault by the 3rd Amazons army group on the Sacred Order village of Omni, located in area</pre>
<pre>     IL of Amberland: It was already known that Omni had as its main defensive structure a</pre>
<pre>     surrounding wall, containing several unreinforced gates. When the sun had risen to its</pre>
<pre>     highest point, Lord Commander Goodkind commanded his 3rd Amazons army group to engage the</pre>
<pre>     village. As the attackers swept over the flat grasslands, the battle began. In the initial</pre>
<pre>     minutes of battle, defending missilers were too few to concern the determined attackers.</pre>
<pre>     The Amazons ranks caused tremendous casualties upon the village's defenders. Within a few</pre>
<pre>     hours, the village defenses were obliterated and an unconditional surrender was offered.</pre>
<pre>     The Amazons banner now waves nobly in Omni! Amazons casualties were put at 1%. All Amazons</pre>
<pre>     leaders survived the battle. Impressing his peers was Goodkind, who again has</pre>
<pre>     distinguished himself. He is now a Warlord. The troops are eager for more victories:</pre>
<pre>     morale is up! </pre>

<pre>     Each spellcaster may cast one spell per turn. Spells cast count as orders used against the</pre>

<pre>     Order # column of the turn input sheet, the group ID of the wizard's group to be placed in</pre>
<pre>     Column 'A', and the wizard's power-level (eg:'2') or the specific casting wizard's</pre>
<pre>     initials to be placed in Column 'B'. Other columns may need to be completed as dictated by</pre>
<pre>     the specific spell description. Spells not properly completed are miscast and have no</pre>
<pre>     effect. We suggest that you use either power levels, or the first two letters of the</pre>

<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Protect Heroes and Wizards               Spell #:   94</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By casting this spell, the wizard seeks to protect all heroes and wizards of his</pre>
<pre>      group from the black magics of a particular opposing group's spellcasters. This spell</pre>
<pre>      is always successful, but is only effective against one group and may only be cast</pre>
<pre>      upon the group in which the wizard is located. It protects all the group's leaders</pre>
<pre>      and wizards, even against multiple attacks unless dispelled. Put group ID of target</pre>
<pre>      group in Column "C".</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Stun Leader                              Spell #:   95</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      The wizard casting this spell seeks to render the opposing commander ineffective for</pre>
<pre>      the duration of a battle. Your group must engage the target group in combat for this</pre>
<pre>      spell to be effective. Base chance of success is 100% * difference in level of</pre>
<pre>      ability (general considered equal to power-2 wizard for this purpose). eg: A power-1</pre>
<pre>      wizard has a 33% {100%*(1/3)} of stunning a marshal. Put group ID of target group in</pre>
<pre>      Column "C".</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Shield                                   Spell #:  100</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This spell causes a glimmering shield of magic to protect the force, and increases</pre>
<pre>      the defensive values of the wizard's group, effectively reducing the casualties it</pre>
<pre>      will suffer from battle with a specific opposing group or a population center. The</pre>
<pre>      amount of benefit received increases with the power level of the spellcaster. Put the</pre>
<pre>      group ID of the opposing target group in Column "C", or if cast against a population</pre>
<pre>      center, leave Column "C" blank.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Lightning Attack                         Spell #:  102</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      The lightning attack is the most commonly known offensive battle spell. The spell</pre>
<pre>      sends dozens of lightning bolts screaming through enemy formations. The base power of</pre>
<pre>      the attack is dependent upon spellcaster power: 500 points per level. Against</pre>
<pre>      divisions, the damage is 150%, damage is 200% vs. armies, and 250% vs. army groups.</pre>
<pre>      Against towns, damage is 125%, against cities, damage is 150%. Your group must battle</pre>
<pre>      the target group for the spell to be effective. Put group ID of target group in</pre>
<pre>      Column "C", or if cast against a population center, leave Column "C" blank.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Valor                                    Spell #:  108</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      The wizard casts this spell as battle is about to begin. Invigorating aromas spread</pre>
<pre>      through the ranks, filling the minds of the troops with thoughts of heroism, courage</pre>
<pre>      and determination. Morale is increased by 10% for the  duration of the combat. Your</pre>
<pre>      group must battle the target group for the spell to be effective. Put group ID of</pre>
<pre>      target group in Column "C", or if cast against a population center, leave Column "C"</pre>
<pre>      blank.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Create Food                              Spell #:  208</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      Wizards in Alamaze can create bountiful quantities of food out of almost any organic</pre>
<pre>      substance. In game terms, a wizard can create food equal to 2000 units * his power</pre>
<pre>      level (eg: a power-3  wizard creates 6000 food) by casting this spell. Food created</pre>
<pre>      is added to available quantities on hand. No Columns beyond Column "B" need be</pre>
<pre>      completed.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Ward                                     Spell #:  301</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This spell protects a specific emissary of any kingdom from the black magic of an</pre>
<pre>      opposing spellcaster, and helps guard against foul play of the more earthly variety.</pre>
<pre>      Spells directed against the warded emissary will be ineffective, and other attacks</pre>
<pre>      against him will have a 20% diminished chance of working. A ward spell effectively</pre>
<pre>      hids an emissary from a locate spell. Place the kingdom abbreviation to which the</pre>
<pre>      emissary belongs in Column "C", and the emissary abbreviation in Column "D".</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Learn Artifact Power                     Spell #:  796</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By using this spell, a wizard can learn what powers are stored within an artifact in</pre>
<pre>      his kingdom's possession. Information learned may be of a general nature, but it will</pre>
<pre>      be sufficient to enable the king to know best how to utilize the artifact. Artifact</pre>
<pre>      must be in the same area as the wizard. Put the short name of the artifact in Column</pre>
<pre>      "C". Only very basic information will be learned.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Magic Research                           Spell #:  799</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This is the means by which a spellcaster advances his power. The wizard must be</pre>
<pre>      located in a kingdom controlled population center in order to perform his research.</pre>
<pre>      The cost to the controlling king is shown on the setup sheet data (eg: if cost shown</pre>
<pre>      is 10,000 gold per level, it would cost 20,000 gold to advance from power-1 to</pre>
<pre>      power-2). No Columns beyond Column "B" need be completed.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Raven Familiar                           Spell #:  888</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By using this spell a wizard may order his raven familiar to perform a reconnaisance</pre>
<pre>      of an area exactly as a first level agent would. The target area must be within a ten</pre>
<pre>      area range of the spellcaster's group. The results will be reported in the "agents on</pre>
<pre>      reconnaisance" section of the status update. Put target area in Column "C".</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><p class="hdr1red">     Power-2 Spells for the Amazons</p></pre>
<pre>     Each spellcaster may cast one spell per turn. Spells cast count as orders used against the</pre>
<pre>     king's influence order limitation. Each spell requires the spell # to be placed in the</pre>
<pre>     Order # column of the turn input sheet, the group ID of the wizard's group to be placed in</pre>
<pre>     Column 'A', and the wizard's power-level (eg:'2') or the specific casting wizard's</pre>

<pre>     the specific spell description. Spells not properly completed are miscast and have no</pre>

<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Dispel Magic                             Spell #:   92</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This spell is directed against a group containing spellcasters in the same area as</pre>
<pre>      the casting wizard's group. This spell has a 100% chance of dispelling a battle spell</pre>
<pre>      of an equal or lessor level wizard, less 25% per level disparity when attempting to</pre>
<pre>      dispel incantations of a higher level spellcaster. You may optionally list in Column</pre>
<pre>      D the lowest spell # you wish to dispel (eg- "98"). Your group need not engage in</pre>
<pre>      combat to use this spell. Put group ID of target group in Column "C".</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Kill Leader/Wizard                       Spell #:   96</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      The wizard casting this spell seeks to slay a particular opposing hero or</pre>
<pre>      spellcaster. The base chance of success is 50% * difference in level of ability</pre>
<pre>      (general considered equal to a power-2 wizard for this purpose). eg: A power-1 wizard</pre>
<pre>      has a 16.3% {50%*(1/3)} of slaying a marshal and a power-6 has a 75% chance of</pre>
<pre>      killing a power-4, and a power-3 has a 30% chance of killing a power-5. Put the group</pre>
<pre>      ID of the target group in Column "C", place "W" or "L" (for wizard or leader) in</pre>
<pre>      Column "D", place "H" or "L" (high or low) in Column "E". Your group need not have</pre>
<pre>      combat for this spell; but must be in the same location as the group containing the</pre>
<pre>      figure you desire to slay.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Fear                                     Spell #:  107</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By casting this spell the wizard creates illusionary sights, sounds and smells</pre>
<pre>      intended to terrify enemy soldiers. The effect is a drop of 10% in the morale, and so</pre>
<pre>      fighting ability, of the enemy troops for the duration of the battle (not a permanent</pre>
<pre>      effect). Your group must battle the target group for the spell to be effective. Put</pre>
<pre>      group ID of target group in Column "C". Not effective against population centers.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Diplomacy                                Spell #:  171</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      A wizard may cast this spell when his group intends to parley with a population</pre>
<pre>      center. The group's effectiveness will be increased in proportion to his power level.</pre>
<pre>      Use this spell instead of order #170 (not in addition to it). By using this spell the</pre>
<pre>      groups leaders appear more charismatic to the center's leaders than they otherwise</pre>
<pre>      would. No Columns beyond Column "B" need be completed. This spell has no effect if</pre>
<pre>      the population center is a capital. Regional reaction, enemy status, previous month's</pre>
<pre>      status quo, and the population center's defenses impact upon the chance of success.</pre>
<pre>      In Second Cycle, this spell, when used in an effort to gain a city must overcome the</pre>
<pre>      same percentage negitive modifier as political actions.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Create Gold                              Spell #:  209</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      Wizards can create gold from lesser metals in sizeable quantities, although the</pre>
<pre>      procedure can take several weeks. In game terms, a wizard can create gold equal to</pre>
<pre>      2000 units * his power level (eg: a power-3  wizard creates 6000 gold) by casting</pre>
<pre>      this spell. Gold created is added to available quantities on hand. No Columns beyond</pre>
<pre>      Column "B" need be completed.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Fertile Fields                           Spell #:  602</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By casting this spell a mage increases the food production of the population center</pre>
<pre>      his group is in by 2,500, permanently. The population center need not be controlled</pre>
<pre>      by the spellcaster's kingdom. No Columns beyond Column "B" need be completed. Note:</pre>
<pre>      As this spell is after production the increase will be reflected on the next result.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Ship of Mist                             Spell #:  708</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By casting this spell, the wizard creates a fleet of mist-made ships, enough to</pre>
<pre>      transport one brigade per power-level magically over any sea. movement is at the</pre>
<pre>      normal rate for the kingdom. In addition, the group is not subject to interdiction by</pre>
<pre>      sea patrol or the spell Storm at Sea. However, the group may not end its movement in</pre>
<pre>      a sea area. Movement can not be increased by any method. Use in place of a normal</pre>
<pre>      movement order, not in addition to. Complete Columns "C" on to indicate intended</pre>
<pre>      movement area by area.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Speed                                    Spell #:  718</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      The wizard creates an invigorating aroma which greatly aids the groups movement</pre>
<pre>      capabilities. Movement allowance is increased 2.5 pts. per level of the spellcaster.</pre>
<pre>      (power-2 caster's group could move 25 points.) Use in place of normal movement order.</pre>
<pre>      Limit of 8 areas maximum movement. This spell will not increase sea movement and can</pre>
<pre>      not be used with a forced march. Complete Columns "C" on to indicate intended</pre>
<pre>      movement area by area.</pre>

<pre><p class="hdr1red">     Power-3 Spells for the Amazons</p></pre>
<pre>     Each spellcaster may cast one spell per turn. Spells cast count as orders used against the</pre>

<br>
<pre>      This is not a spell, but rather a bonus which accrues to all third level spellcasters</pre>
<pre>      and above, significantly increasing their combat abilities. This bonus increases in</pre>
<pre>      proportion to the wizard's power.  Wizards of this power and beyond can cast any of</pre>
<pre>      their available spells which may aid their group's offensive and defensive</pre>

<pre><i>     Name:    Instant Self Teleport                    Spell #:   88</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This spell allows a high level wizard to teleport himself to another group of his</pre>
<pre>      kingdom before a battle ensues, thus allowing his powers of presence to favorably</pre>
<pre>      effect an eminent combat with the new group or avoid the perils of combat with his</pre>
<pre>      existing group. The spellcaster may not cast another spell in conjunction with this</pre>
<pre>      spell, however. Place the group ID of the group in your kingdom the wizard will</pre>
<pre>      teleport to in Column "C". There is no distance or area restrictions with this spell,</pre>
<pre>      however the target group cannot already contain 3 wizards.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Wall of Flame                            Spell #:   98</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By casting this spell the wizard creates a 20' deep, 20' high and very long wall of</pre>
<pre>      flame between his group and a potentially hostile group in the same area. This wall</pre>
<pre>      of flame prevents attacks from all but the most determined attackers. Determined</pre>
<pre>      attackers will suffer significant damage crossing the wall, prior to the combat.</pre>
<pre>      Multiple castings of this spell are possible, but the effects are not cumulative.</pre>
<pre>      This spell is a defensive spell and is not effective against dragons. Put the target</pre>
<pre>      group ID in "C".</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Guarded Attack                           Spell #:  101</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This is a sophisticated spell in which the spellcaster becomes invisible, thereby</pre>
<pre>      protecting himself from the hazards of battle, and sends forth powerful sonic blasts</pre>
<pre>      into the enemy lines, inflicting casualties in proportion to the spellcasters power:</pre>
<pre>      300 points per level. Your group must battle the target group for the spell to be</pre>
<pre>      effective. Put group ID of target group in Column "C", or if cast against a</pre>
<pre>      population center or in an unusual sighting, leave Column "C" blank. When used in an</pre>
<pre>      unusual sighting it reduces the wizard's effectiveness by 50%.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Firestrike                               Spell #:  103</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      The firestrike is a powerful offensive battle spell. The spell sends rolling waves of</pre>
<pre>      magically hot flames sizzling into enemy lines. The base power of the attack is</pre>
<pre>      dependent upon spellcaster power: 700 points per level. Against divisions, the damage</pre>
<pre>      is 150%, damage is 200% vs. armies, and 250% vs. army groups. Against towns, damage</pre>
<pre>      is 125%, against cities, damage is 150%. Your group must battle the target group for</pre>
<pre>      the spell to be effective. Put group ID of target group in Column "C", or if cast</pre>
<pre>      against a population center, leave Column "C" blank.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Sleep                                    Spell #:  305</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This spell places the target emissary in a magically deep sleep, similar to a coma.</pre>
<pre>      The emissary remains in such a state for one month (the game turn) during which time</pre>
<pre>      he obviously can perform no activity. A slept emissary is more susceptible to</pre>
<pre>      kidnapping and assassination attempts. There are various types of magic that can</pre>
<pre>      effect the success of this spell. This spell requires  the caster to know the</pre>
<pre>      target's name (and so emissary abb.), his kingdom, and his location. Place the</pre>
<pre>      kingdom abbreviation to which the emissary belongs in "C", the emissary abbreviation</pre>
<pre>      in "D", and the location in "E".</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Strengthen Walls                         Spell #:  601</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This incantation allows a mage to increase the existing defenses of the population</pre>
<pre>      center in the same area as his group by 2,000, permanently. The population center</pre>
<pre>      need not be controlled by the spellcaster's kingdom. No Columns beyond Column "B"</pre>
<pre>      need be completed. Note: As this spell is after production the results be be</pre>
<pre>      reflected on the next result.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Hidden Ore                               Spell #:  603</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      When located in the same area as a population center, by casting this spell a mage</pre>
<pre>      can uncover hidden ore reserves in that area. Gold production of the population</pre>
<pre>      center will increase by 2500 gold permanently. No Columns beyond Column "B" need be</pre>
<pre>      completed. Note: As this spell is after production, the increase will be reflected on</pre>
<pre>      the next result.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Raise Population Center census           Spell #:  610</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      When located in the same area as a population center, by casting this spell a mage</pre>
<pre>      increases the census by 2,500 permanently. The population center need not be</pre>
<pre>      controlled by the spellcaster's kingdom. No Columns beyond Column "B" need be</pre>
<pre>      completed.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Dispel Storm at Sea                      Spell #:  661</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This spell is very similar to the dispel magic spell, however instead of dispelling</pre>
<pre>      battle spells, it works against the Storm at Sea spell. The same chance of success as</pre>
<pre>      exists in Dispel Magic apply here (100% chance of dispelling versus equal or lesser</pre>
<pre>      level wizard, less 25% per level disparity when attempting to dispel incantation of a</pre>
<pre>      higher level spellcaster). The spellcaster must be within 3 areas of any area</pre>
<pre>      comprising that sea.  Specify the first letter of the sea to be effected in Column</pre>
<pre>      "C", and an area of the sea within 3 areas of the wizard in Column "D".</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Protection from Regional Effect          Spell #:  778</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This spell offers the group containing the spellcaster the means to be protected from</pre>
<pre>      the effects of a non-allied wizard's regional effect spell. This peculiar spell will</pre>
<pre>      protect the group from a single regional effect spell only; there is no way to</pre>
<pre>      specify a particular regional spell. No Columns beyond Column "B" need be completed.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Dispel Regional Effect                   Spell #:  779</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This spell is very similar to the dispel magic spell, however instead of dispelling</pre>
<pre>      battle spells, it works against regional effect spells (#781-788). This spell has a</pre>
<pre>      100% chance of dispelling a regional spell of an equal or lessor level wizard, less</pre>
<pre>      25% per level of disparity when attempting to dispel incantations of a higher level</pre>
<pre>      spellcaster. No Columns beyond Column "B" need be completed.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Lesser Masking                           Spell #:  821</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By using this spell the wizard through use of mist, smoke, and illusion obscures the</pre>
<pre>      size of his smaller sized (up to 5 brigades) group. Foreign groups (and possibly</pre>
<pre>      agents) will be unable to determine the group size or strength. If used in a group</pre>
<pre>      larger than division sized there will be no effect. A successful casting will result</pre>
<pre>      in the group size will be reported as "masked". No Columns beyond Column "B" need be</pre>
<pre>      completed.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Teleport Self                            Spell #:  830</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By using this spell the wizard can teleport himself in to another group of his</pre>
<pre>      kingdom, regardless of distance from  his present location. The receiving group must</pre>
<pre>      be of his own kingdom, and cannot already contain three wizards. Place the receiving</pre>
<pre>      group's ID in Column "C". There are no distance or area restrictions with this spell.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Locate Character or Group                Spell #:  855</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This spell allows the spellcaster to learn, through deep trance-induced meditations,</pre>
<pre>      the location of a specific group or emissary of any kingdom. certain magic may</pre>
<pre>      interfere with this process (such as a Ward spell) but normally it is quite</pre>
<pre>      effective. Place "G" or"E" (group or emissary) in Column "C", the group ID or</pre>
<pre>      emissary abb. in Column "D", and the kingdom abb.of the group or emissary in Column</pre>
<pre>      "E".</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><p class="hdr1red">     Power-4 Spells for the Amazons</p></pre>
<pre>     Each spellcaster may cast one spell per turn. Spells cast count as orders used against the</pre>
<pre>     king's influence order limitation. Each spell requires the spell # to be placed in the</pre>
<pre>     Order # column of the turn input sheet, the group ID of the wizard's group to be placed in</pre>
<pre>     Column 'A', and the wizard's power-level (eg:'2') or the specific casting wizard's</pre>
<pre>     initials to be placed in Column 'B'. Other columns may need to be completed as dictated by</pre>
<pre>     the specific spell description. Spells not properly completed are miscast and have no</pre>
<pre>     effect. We suggest that you use either power levels, or the first two letters of the</pre>
<pre>     wizards name, but not both in any given turn in order to avoid any confusion around which</pre>
<pre>     wizard may or may not be used.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Chaos                                    Spell #:  106</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      The wizard casts a spell which creates distracting, hypnotic patterns, illusions and</pre>
<pre>      confusing sounds which cause enemy troops to ignore many commands of their leaders.</pre>
<pre>      The effect is that the enemy will be unable to effectively withdraw at their defined</pre>
<pre>      retreat level. If the opposing group contains a warlord, this spell will be</pre>
<pre>      ineffective. If the opposing group contains a marshal, the spell's effect will be</pre>
<pre>      reduced. Your group must battle the  target group for the spell to be effective and</pre>
<pre>      lasts for the duration of this single battle. It is possible  that the spell caster's</pre>
<pre>      group might retreat should it suffer enough damage to reach it's retreat factor. Put</pre>
<pre>      group ID of target group in Column "C".</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Ancient Intervention                     Spell #:  109</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      The wizard casting this exhausting magic is able to prevent combat between two forces</pre>
<pre>      anywhere in the realm, both groups are affected and no combat takes place as a result</pre>
<pre>      of this powerful spell. The Ancient Intervention spell however drains 1 power level</pre>
<pre>      from the wizard but the loss may be regained normally through magic research (order</pre>
<pre>      #799). Put group ID of one target group in Column "C" and the 2nd group ID in Column</pre>
<pre>      "D".</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Ward Population Center                   Spell #:  130</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This spell works against one destroy or damage population center spell. Spells</pre>
<pre>      directed against the warded pc will be ineffective (no damage caused). Range is</pre>
<pre>      within the spellcaster's region. Put the target location in Column "C". no other</pre>
<pre>      Columns need be completed.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Reveal King's Influence                  Spell #:  370</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By using this spell the wizard will learn the influence of any king/queen/regent.</pre>
<pre>      Place the desired kingdom's initials in Column "C" and the king's initials in Column</pre>
<pre>      "D". This spell has an effect similar to that of order #365 (Learn King's Influence).</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Storm at Sea                             Spell #:  660</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This spell causes crashing, treacherous seas and violent storms to rage throughout a</pre>
<pre>      particular sea, preventing all normal sea movement in that sea by all kingdoms. Due</pre>
<pre>      to the hurricane force winds accompanied by this spell, all means of flight across</pre>
<pre>      the sea by naturally flying kingdoms (e.g., Dragons) are prevented as well. The</pre>
<pre>      spellcaster must be within 3 areas of any area comprising that sea. Specify the first</pre>
<pre>      letter of the sea to be effected in Column "C", and an area of the sea within 3 areas</pre>
<pre>      of the wizard in Column "D".</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Greater Masking                          Spell #:  822</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By using this spell the wizard through use of mist, smoke, and illusion obscures the</pre>
<pre>      size of his group. Foreign groups (and possibly agents) will be unable to determine</pre>
<pre>      the group size or strength. Group size will be reported as "masked". No Columns</pre>
<pre>      beyond Column "B" need be completed.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Invisible Brigade                        Spell #:  845</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This spell allows the wizard's brigade sized (up to 2 brigades) group to become</pre>
<pre>      invisible and so undetected by groups and agents alike. This is of course an</pre>
<pre>      excellent way to avoid combat or surprise an unsuspecting foe. Spell lasts for that</pre>
<pre>      month (game turn) cast. No Columns beyond Column "B" need be completed.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Teleport Brigade                         Spell #:  850</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This spell allows the wizard to teleport his brigade sized group (no more than 2</pre>
<pre>      brigades) to any area in Alamaze, without range restriction. Use in place of a</pre>
<pre>      movement order. You may not designate a sea terrain area as the destination. Specify</pre>
<pre>      the destination area in Column "C". If this group has been issued an order-745 (rest</pre>
<pre>      group) it is unable to move (be teleported) as it should have received the benefits</pre>
<pre>      of the rest order.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Summon Monsters                          Spell #:  860</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This spell may only be cast in a forest area. The spell caster through this spell</pre>
<pre>      causes large numbers (a brigade's worth) of humanoid type beings to emerge from the</pre>
<pre>      surrounding forest and join his group. Monsters (MO) are considered one of the</pre>
<pre>      brigade types allowed per group. Monster brigades must be fed but need not be paid.</pre>
<pre>      They consume food at the same rate as other troops of the kingdom and if they are not</pre>
<pre>      fed they will suffer the normal 10% morale loss. Combat ability is slightly superior</pre>
<pre>      to recruits. No further Columns need be completed.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Heal                                     Spell #:  815</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      The wizard dedicates his time and magical energy to imbue additional food rations for</pre>
<pre>      his group with restorative powers. By consuming this magical food, the group's</pre>
<pre>      wounded memebers are restored to fighting capability and attrition reduced according</pre>
<pre>      to the following schedule: Brigade sized groups require an additional 4000 food and</pre>
<pre>      have their attrition reduced by 5 points. Division sized groups require an additional</pre>
<pre>      8000 food and have their attrition reduced by 4 points. Army sized groups require and</pre>
<pre>      additional 16000 food and have their attrition reduced by 3 points. This spell will</pre>
<pre>      have reduced effectiveness if a previous healing has been performed on the group,</pre>
<pre>      either by a high priestess order or a previous casting of this spell. If the group</pre>
<pre>      has been healed once before, attrition will be reduced by 2 fewer points than listed</pre>
<pre>      above (eg. brigade sized groups will reduce attrition by 3, division by 2, army by</pre>
<pre>      only 1). The spell will have no effect, other than food consumption, if the group has</pre>
<pre>      already received two prior healings through any combination of high priestess orders</pre>
<pre>      or spells. No Columns beyond "B" are required.</pre>
