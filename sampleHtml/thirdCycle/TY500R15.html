<pre>                          believed Duke Zori Ma Latel of the Atlantians kingdom was behind the</pre>

<br>
<pre>     Circanus             The people of Circanus (Area UV) have rebelled against our rulership!</pre>

<pre>                          Neutral village of Olive Hill located in area JR: I found a motivated core</pre>
<pre>                          of resistance resisting my overtures, in support of the general monarchy.</pre>
<pre>                          There seemed no rebellous political unrest in favor of changing the</pre>
<pre>                          government. My rousing oratories have have won over the people here to our</pre>
<pre>                          kingdom!</pre>

<pre>                          Warlock village of Vexilia Path located in area GW: I feared my strategy</pre>
<pre>                          would need to take into account the Warlock control over Talking Mountains.</pre>
<pre>                          Although the people of Talking Mountains seemed pleased with the Warlock</pre>
<pre>                          rule, I adjusted my approach. There seemed no organized conservative body</pre>
<pre>                          in support of the government. There was no apparent radical body in favor</pre>
<pre>                          of changing the government. I am honored to report that my well received</pre>
<pre>                          speeches have prompted the people here to rebel against their former ruler</pre>
<pre>                          and join our kingdom!</pre>

<pre>                          Atlantians village of Petal Top located in area IU: I feared my plans would</pre>
<pre>                          need to take into account the Atlantians control over Eastern Steppes.</pre>
<pre>                          Although the people of Eastern Steppes seemed almost enthralled with the</pre>
<pre>                          Atlantians rule, I modified my plan. There seemed no active political</pre>
<pre>                          support in support of the government. There seemed no rebellous political</pre>
<pre>                          unrest in favor of changing the government. I am proud to report that my</pre>
<pre>                          subtle, undetected deals have prompted the people here to rebel against</pre>
<pre>                          their former ruler and join our kingdom!</pre>
<br>
<pre>     Thunder Plain        The people of Thunder Plain (Area MZ) have rebelled against our rulership!</pre>
<pre>                          They have joined the Atlantians kingdom. It is believed their Duchess</pre>
<pre>                          Nunidon was behind the uprising.</pre>

<br>
<pre>     Assault by the 1st Atlantians army group on the Tyrant city of Jukanta, located in area OV</pre>
<pre>     of Synisvania: It was already known that Jukanta was protected to an unprecedented degree,</pre>
<pre>     3 thick walls and a skilled garrison fronted a defense which included 20 catapults and 100</pre>
<pre>     ballistae. Late in the afternoon, Commander Rover commanded his 1st Atlantians army group</pre>
<pre>     to execute the attack on the city. Due to the ruthless nature of the Tyrant, the city's</pre>
<pre>     defenders were determined to fight vigorously against an attack. As the most important</pre>
<pre>     group of their nation, the troops are visibly bolstered by the presence of the first</pre>
<pre>     Atlantians's banner! As the attackers swept over the tall woods, the first missles sang</pre>
<pre>     out. Early in the battle, defending missilers were skilled, and stalled the attack in the</pre>
<pre>     early going. The Atlantians lines claimed severe casualties upon the city's protectors.</pre>
<pre>     Atlantians mages dismounted barely past where the defensive missles were falling and began</pre>
<pre>     an animated spell. Power-4 wizard Prosperity muttered a few words in a foreign tongue, in</pre>
<pre>     rapid succession were cast many minor phantasms and magical bolts into the ranks of the</pre>
<pre>     enemy. Power-4 wizard Prosperity began sorcerous incantations in an unknown tongue. A</pre>
<pre>     massive ball of fire sped toward the main ranks of the enemy and exploded! Power-4 wizard</pre>
<pre>     Quagmire began sorcerous incantations in an unknown tongue, with chilling ease he fired</pre>
<pre>     many volleys of killing illusions and waves of deadly cold into the heart of the enemy</pre>
<pre>     force. Power-4 wizard Quagmire slowly spoke in an arcane language, gestures building to a</pre>
<pre>     crescendo. A massive ball of fire sped toward the main ranks of the enemy and exploded!</pre>
<pre>     Power-1 wizard Aeolus while seemingly detached from all else, seemed to draw within</pre>
<pre>     himself and began to incant. A faintly visible blue shimmering began to surround the</pre>
<pre>     troops and noticeably lessened the effectiveness of the arrows of the defenders. The</pre>
<pre>     Atlantians mages caused tremendous casualties upon the wall defenders. In the initial</pre>
<pre>     minutes of battle, defending missilers were skilled, and stalled the attack in the early</pre>
<pre>     going. The Atlantians forces caused heavy damage upon the city's wall defenders. Within a</pre>
<pre>     few hours, the city defenses were obliterated and an unconditional surrender was offered.</pre>
<pre>     The Atlantians banner now waves nobly in Jukanta! Atlantians casualties were put at 12%.</pre>
<pre>     All Atlantians leaders survived the battle. Impressing his peers was Shanna, who once</pre>
<pre>     again has distinguished himself. He is now a Commander. All the Atlantians wizards</pre>
<pre>     survived the fray. The troops are eager for more victories: morale is up! </pre>

<pre>      </pre>
<pre>     Attack by the 3rd Tyrant army group on the Atlantians city of Gundibar, located in area KU</pre>
<pre>     of Eastern Steppes: It was already known that Gundibar had a seemingly impregnable defense</pre>
<pre>     such as the realm had never before seen. Early in the day, Captain Major Elbryan commanded</pre>
<pre>     his 3rd Tyrant army group to begin the attack upon the city. As the attackers swept over</pre>
<pre>     the fog-laden swamp, the battle began. Early in the battle, defending missilers were</pre>
<pre>     skilled, and stalled the attack in the early going. The Tyrant lines caused severe</pre>
<pre>     casualties upon the city's wall defenders. As the attackers approached, defending</pre>
<pre>     missilers were able to eliminate entire companies of the attacking force. The Tyrant lines</pre>
<pre>     dealt out tremendous losses upon the city's defenders. It readily became apparent that the</pre>
<pre>     defending troops were of typical quality for the region. Within a few hours, the city</pre>
<pre>     defenses were obliterated and an unconditional surrender was offered. The Tyrant banner</pre>
<pre>     now waves nobly in Gundibar! Tyrant casualties were put at 25%. Tragically, the Tyrant</pre>
<pre>     Centurion JUMPINGFIST did not survive. The troops are anxious for further glory: morale is</pre>
<pre>     up! </pre>

<pre>      </pre>
<pre>     Assault by the 1st Tyrant army group on the Warlock city of Hammerhold, located in area CU</pre>
<pre>     of Talking Mountains: Paid informants revealed that Hammerhold had a seemingly impregnable</pre>
<pre>     defense such as the realm had never before seen. When the sun had risen to its highest</pre>
<pre>     point, Major General Golindar commanded his 1st Tyrant army group to execute the attack on</pre>
<pre>     the city. As the most important group of their nation, the forces are visibly bolstered by</pre>
<pre>     the presence of the first Tyrant's banner! As the attackers swept over the open</pre>
<pre>     battlefield, the first missles sang out. Early in the battle, defending missilers were</pre>
<pre>     able to still forever some small percent of their antagonists. The Tyrant lines caused</pre>
<pre>     appreciable damage upon the city's garrison. Tyrant mages dismounted scarcely beyond the</pre>
<pre>     range of defending bowmen and began an incomprehensible spell. Power-1 wizard Aqua threw</pre>
<pre>     back his hood and gestured in an animated fashion. Crackling lightning leaped from the</pre>
<pre>     wizard's fingers and streaked toward the main ranks of the enemy! Power-1 wizard Kalomon</pre>
<pre>     slowly spoke in an arcane language, gestures building to a crescendo. Crackling lightning</pre>
<pre>     leaped from the wizard's fingers and streaked toward the main ranks of the enemy! The</pre>
<pre>     Tyrant mages imposed minor losses upon the garrison. As the attackers approached,</pre>
<pre>     defending missilers were heartened by their clear success in the first hour, inflicting</pre>
<pre>     significant casualties on the attackers. The Tyrant forces caused devastating damage upon</pre>
<pre>     the city's defenders. It readily became clear that the defending troops were of typical</pre>
<pre>     quality for the region. Within a few hours, the city defenses were obliterated and an</pre>
<pre>     unconditional surrender was offered. The Tyrant banner now waves nobly in Hammerhold!</pre>
<pre>     Tyrant casualties were put at 19%. All Tyrant leaders survived the battle. Golindar</pre>
<pre>     distinguished himself and has been elevated as a Commander. Cirdan distinguished himself</pre>
<pre>     and has been elevated as a Major General. Yergin demonstrated tactical awareness and has</pre>
<pre>     been elevated as a Captain Major. In a setback, the Tyrant Power-1 Kalomon died of his</pre>
<pre>     wounds. The troops are anxious for more victories: morale is up! </pre>

<pre>     Each spellcaster may cast one spell per turn. Spells cast count as orders used against the</pre>

<pre>     Order # column of the turn input sheet, the group ID of the wizard's group to be placed in</pre>
<pre>     Column 'A', and the wizard's power-level (eg:'2') or the specific casting wizard's</pre>
<pre>     initials to be placed in Column 'B'. Other columns may need to be completed as dictated by</pre>
<pre>     the specific spell description. Spells not properly completed are miscast and have no</pre>
<pre>     effect. We suggest that you use either power levels, or the first two letters of the</pre>
<pre>     wizards name, but not both in any given turn in order to avoid any confusion around which</pre>

<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Protect Heroes and Wizards               Spell #:   94</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By casting this spell, the wizard seeks to protect all heroes and wizards of his</pre>
<pre>      group from the black magics of a particular opposing group's spellcasters. This spell</pre>
<pre>      is always successful, but is only effective against one group and may only be cast</pre>
<pre>      upon the group in which the wizard is located. It protects all the group's leaders</pre>
<pre>      and wizards, even against multiple attacks unless dispelled. Put group ID of target</pre>
<pre>      group in Column "C".</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Stun Leader                              Spell #:   95</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      The wizard casting this spell seeks to render the opposing commander ineffective for</pre>
<pre>      the duration of a battle. Your group must engage the target group in combat for this</pre>
<pre>      spell to be effective. Base chance of success is 100% * difference in level of</pre>
<pre>      ability (general considered equal to power-2 wizard for this purpose). eg: A power-1</pre>
<pre>      wizard has a 33% {100%*(1/3)} of stunning a marshal. Put group ID of target group in</pre>
<pre>      Column "C".</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Lightning Attack                         Spell #:  102</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      The lightning attack is the most commonly known offensive battle spell. The spell</pre>
<pre>      sends dozens of lightning bolts screaming through enemy formations. The base power of</pre>
<pre>      the attack is dependent upon spellcaster power: 500 points per level. Against</pre>
<pre>      divisions, the damage is 150%, damage is 200% vs. armies, and 250% vs. army groups.</pre>
<pre>      Against towns, damage is 125%, against cities, damage is 150%. Your group must battle</pre>
<pre>      the target group for the spell to be effective. Put group ID of target group in</pre>
<pre>      Column "C", or if cast against a population center, leave Column "C" blank.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Fear                                     Spell #:  107</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By casting this spell the wizard creates illusionary sights, sounds and smells</pre>
<pre>      intended to terrify enemy soldiers. The effect is a drop of 10% in the morale, and so</pre>
<pre>      fighting ability, of the enemy troops for the duration of the battle (not a permanent</pre>
<pre>      effect). Your group must battle the target group for the spell to be effective. Put</pre>
<pre>      group ID of target group in Column "C". Not effective against population centers.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Create Food                              Spell #:  208</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      Wizards in Alamaze can create bountiful quantities of food out of almost any organic</pre>
<pre>      substance. In game terms, a wizard can create food equal to 2000 units * his power</pre>
<pre>      level (eg: a power-3  wizard creates 6000 food) by casting this spell. Food created</pre>
<pre>      is added to available quantities on hand. No Columns beyond Column "B" need be</pre>
<pre>      completed.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Learn Artifact Power                     Spell #:  796</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By using this spell, a wizard can learn what powers are stored within an artifact in</pre>
<pre>      his kingdom's possession. Information learned may be of a general nature, but it will</pre>
<pre>      be sufficient to enable the king to know best how to utilize the artifact. Artifact</pre>
<pre>      must be in the same area as the wizard. Put the short name of the artifact in Column</pre>
<pre>      "C". Only very basic information will be learned.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Magic Research                           Spell #:  799</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      This is the means by which a spellcaster advances his power. The wizard must be</pre>
<pre>      located in a kingdom controlled population center in order to perform his research.</pre>
<pre>      The cost to the controlling king is shown on the setup sheet data (eg: if cost shown</pre>
<pre>      is 10,000 gold per level, it would cost 20,000 gold to advance from power-1 to</pre>
<pre>      power-2). No Columns beyond Column "B" need be completed.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre><i>     Name:    Raven Familiar                           Spell #:  888</i></pre>
<br>
<pre>      By using this spell a wizard may order his raven familiar to perform a reconnaisance</pre>
<pre>      of an area exactly as a first level agent would. The target area must be within a ten</pre>
<pre>      area range of the spellcaster's group. The results will be reported in the "agents on</pre>
<pre>      reconnaisance" section of the status update. Put target area in Column "C".</pre>
